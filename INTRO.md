Crypto Guy In South Africa (CryptoGuyInZA) is Cryptocurrency Enthusiast in South Africa providing Insight & Sharing Own Experience With Industry Leading Digital Currencies Based on Block Generation Technology.

I am 34 years old and reside in South Africa, my name is Louis. I work as IT consultant and have been working in IT for over 13 years. I have exposure working with various pieces of software and can adapt as needed. I have a personal passion for Cryptos and taking this journey with the Tron community.

I believe that most people involved in Cryptocurrencies are outside of the African continent and are large companies, I would like to be one of the first real independent ambassador for crypto in Africa and want Tron to be one of those Cryptocurrencies. I strongly believe Cryptocurrencies should be for the people and need independent people like me, I do not believe they should be centralized or be controlled by large companies. I also believe that I have excellent English which will assist to expand the Tron message into English speaking countries!
