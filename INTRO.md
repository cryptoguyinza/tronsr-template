Crypto Guy In South Africa (CryptoGuyInZA) is Cryptocurrency Enthusiast in South Africa providing Insight & Sharing Own Experience With Industry Leading Digital Currencies Based on Block Generation Technology.

I am 34 years old and reside in South Africa, my name is Louis. I work as IT consultant and have been working in IT for over 13 years. I have exposure working with various pieces of software and can adapt as needed. I have a personal passion for Cryptos and taking this journey with the Tron community.

I believe that most people involved in Cryptocurrencies are outside of the African continent and are large companies, I would like to be one of the first real independent ambassador for crypto in Africa and want Tron to be one of those Cryptocurrencies. I strongly believe Cryptocurrencies should be for the people and need independent people like me, I do not believe they should be centralized or be controlled by large companies. I also believe that I have excellent English which will assist to expand the Tron message into English speaking countries!

 ### Token Rewards
 
If you hold the Token CryptoGuyInZA token with abreviation CGIZA you get 100% vote boost, yes that is 2x rewards. For every token distrubuted we have 1 trx backing it, that means the tokens minimum value is 1 trx. **Important the 2x is on the token held in your wallet**

So there is two ways to get the token
   1. Buy on one of the dex
      - TronWalletMe
      - Tronscan dex, look unders favourites for CGIZA
      - GOC Exchange
   2. Switch TRX rewards to CGIZA Token. This will be 1:1, this means each trx reward will get 1 token. However as you accumulate CGIZA token you will receive 2x on the token held.
      - After voting for CryptoGuyInZA send 1 trx to address TCLJe8giq47DEwX9PtiSJk64LRhQMtNARf to get token rewards
